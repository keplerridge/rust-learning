# Overview

As I progress in my skills as a software engineer and data scientist. I know that there are many skills that can always be improved on to help make data analysis easier. One of those is understanding searching and sorting algorithms. I also want to touch as many different languages as possible. This is the first time that I have done anything with Rust and gave me an opprotunity to see the syntax a little bit.

This project implements a quicksort function, just the basic one that everyone is aware of. I also setup the standard binary search. This is setup to sort and search in a list of customers from a customer struct that I created and did some comparison overriding on.

Again, this software was just a chance for me to try Rust and to implement useful algorithms in it.

# Development Environment

For this all I used was VSCode, without co-pilot, to 

I used Rust and the standard Rust library.

# Useful Websites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [GeeksForGeeks](geeksforgeeks.org)

# Future Work

- Build a customer list programatically instead of just hard coding it
- Find a way to sort on name alphabetically OR on the amount spent
